            Hey, I'm Prashant Jain, an Artificial Intelligence and Data Science student at Arya College of Engineering & IT with a growing passion for web development and problem-solving. Right now, I'm learning React by building this portfolio from scratchâ€”because nothing teaches better than creating something real.

            I enjoy working with C++ and DSA, and I'm always on the lookout for challenges that push me to think deeper and code smarter. As a member of the Arya Cipher Coding Club, I get to collaborate with like-minded peers, organize workshops, and stay active in a community that inspires me to grow every day.    
        </p>

            Outside of academics, I love exploring new tech stacks, experimenting with side projects, and building ideas that merge creativity with functionality.
